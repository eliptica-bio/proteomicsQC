# proteomicsQC

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of proteomicsQC is to ...

## Installation


```{r}
library(devtools)

```


You can install the released version of proteomicsQC from [github](https://github.com/alzel/proteomicsQC) with:

```{r}
#install_github(repo = "alzel/proteomicsQC")
library(proteomicsQC)
```

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(patchwork)
```


## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r}

#load diann report
load("./data/diann_report.rda")

diann_report
```




What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r }

metadata <- create_metadata(diann_report,
                            INTO = c("Batch", "sample_id", "run_order", "plate_pos",  "well"),
                            file_pattern = "(.*?)_(.*?)_([0-9]+)_([0-9]+)_([A-Za-z0-9]+)\\.wiff\\.dia$")


```

```{r, fig.width=10}
plotExperiment(report = diann_report, metadata = metadata, subtitle = "Test")

```

```{r, echo= FALSE, fig.width=20}
plotFeatureCounts(diann_report, metadata)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plotMissingness(diann_report, metadata)
```



Routine to calculate Z-score over various summaries 
```{r}
diann_report %>%
  filter(!grepl(pattern = ".*?BLANK.*?", perl = T, ignore.case = T, x = File.Name)) %>%
  countStats() -> report_stats


diann_report %>%
  countStats() -> report_stats
```



Plots outliers statistics

```{r, fig.width=12}
diann_report %>%
  countStats() -> report_stats
plotStats(report_stats, Z_THR = 3, stats = c("Zn", "ZTIC", "ZmodTIC")) -> plots

plots[[1]]/plots[[2]]

```

```{r}

```




You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/master/examples>.
